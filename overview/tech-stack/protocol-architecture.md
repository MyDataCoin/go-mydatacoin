# 🏢 Protocol Architecture

The basis of this protocol will be based on the MyDataCoin network. The MyDataCoin network will be a protocol that implements a binding solution for connecting to data holders. The mechanism is a basic decentralized linking solution for interaction between data owners and data holders.

The protocol intends to use the MyDataCoin Bridge implementation, which is the link between the main network and the data holders. It is also planned to use a “MyDataCoin Mapper” solution, which is necessary to combine many accounts from different data holders into one.
