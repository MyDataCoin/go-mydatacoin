## Overview

MyDataCoin is developing a public blockchain based on Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint Core.

The Tendermint Core is a high-performance, consistent, flexible, and secure **consensus** module with strict fork accountability. It relies on [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1460.pdf) with delegation and  [Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint). This advantage provides us a possibility to develop a high-performance, consistent and secure decentralized network.

The Tendermint BFT provides security guarantees, including:

1. **Forks** are never created, provided that half or more validators are honest.
2. **Strict accountability** for fork creation allows determining liability.
3. Transactions are **finalized** as soon as a block is created.\


The Cosmos SDK provides a rich set of modules that address common concerns such as governance, tokens, other standards, and interactions with other blockchains through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Some production-grade modules such as Auth, Bank, Distribution, Mint, etc, are going to be used in MDC.

The signing of a smart agreement between the participants of the system should be carried out using CosmWasm. CosmWasm is a new smart contract platform created for the Cosmos ecosystem.
