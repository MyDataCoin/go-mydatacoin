# ðŸª™ MDC Token Distribution and Supply

The MDC is the native currency of the MyDataCoin blockchain, and is required to participate in block production and purchasing rewards for users as rewards for sharing their data. MDC is an inflationary currency with no MAX supply cap.&#x20;

The initial distribution of MDC is 1 billion tokens. This number includes all categories of token recipients in the distribution schedule, with the exception of data producers, who will receive rewards in the form of dividends for the share of personal data. With an increase in the number of users and data categories, there will be an increase in inflation, which is very important for the system, at the first stages of network development.

#### Inflation

Inflation leads to stimulation. It is useful for network members to have an incentive to participate. For this reason, it was decided to provide high annual rates, such as 20%. Which will ultimately lead to the creation of a healthy network and decentralization. There are two main reasons to stake or delegate MDC:

&#x20;

**Short-term financial gain**

By staking or participating in inflation, holders receive a reward that is proportional to the amount staked or held. This reward may include a block reward or transaction fee proportional to your participation. Conversely, by holding a PoS asset in cold storage or otherwise neglecting participation, the asset could depreciate at a rate of 5% to 20% per year.

\
**Long-term financial gain**

For PoS systems, staking is how the system secures the network. This will reduce the set of possible attackers and help keep the network secure. Systems with inflation use this mechanism to redistribute lost assets. Participation in inflation helps to ensure that assets retain value in the long run.
