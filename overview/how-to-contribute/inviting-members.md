{% endhint %}

Here is a full instruction on how to invite people and earn MDC coins:

1. Open the MyDataCoin application and navigate to the main menu.
2. Click on the "**Get 0.5 MDC**" button to access your referral code.
3. Copy your referral code to your clipboard.
4. Share your referral code with your friends and acquaintances through social media, messaging apps, email, or any other way you prefer.
5. When someone uses your referral code to sign up for the MyDataCoin application, they will receive a bonus of 0.5 MDC coins.
6. Once your referral's account is active and they complete certain tasks, you will receive a reward of 0.5 MDC coins.
7. You can track your referral rewards in the "Referral" section of the MyDataCoin application.

Remember, you can only earn rewards for a limited number of referrals, so make sure to invite your friends and acquaintances early on to maximize your rewards.
